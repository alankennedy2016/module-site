        <p>week 6 exception lab,When executing code, an exception maybe encountered. 
		Often the exception is not visible to the user. 
		The only way they know something is wrong is that what they expect to happen does not happen.
		Sometimes they may not know anything wrong has occurred. For example, a web page loads, everything seems ok,
		but an exception could have occurred which the user is not aware of which will have an impact on other functionality on the web page.  </p>
